git rm node_modules -r --cached


~ git rm --cached <filePath>
does not unstage a file, it actually stages the removal of the file(s) from the
repo (assuming it was already committed before) but leaves the file in your working tree (leaving you with
an untracked file).

~ git reset <filePath>
will unstage any staged changes for the given file(s).

Edit: Thinking about it, though, if you used
~ git rm --cached
on a new file that is staged, it would basically look like you had just unstaged it since it had never been
committed before. Maybe that's what you were seeing?
