GENERATING MODELS AND CONTROLLERS
_________________________________________________

KOI

this will generate a model through koi

~ rails generate koi:admin_controller {model name} title:string description:text image_uid:string

this will generate a controller through koi

~ rails generate koi:controller {controller name}


BILL'S NOTES

~ rails generate koi:admin_controller Blog title:string description:text image_uid:string

That'll generate the admin side of things for you, as well as the model  and the database table. (You should now be able to find the Blog model in your project.)

To generate some front-end views/controller, you can also do this:

~ rails generate koi:controller Blog

<you can skip the name:type attributes here if the model already exists, but you're welcome to include them>

If you're doing a contact form type thing, you'll probably want to use the mailer generator:

~ rails generate koi:mailer ContactForm name:string email:string query:text needs_reply:boolean

That'll create a backend, a front-end, as well as a mailer to email your admin or whoever you specify.
