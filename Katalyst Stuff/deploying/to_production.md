DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION

make sure you are in the project directory.

~ git status

~ git checkout master

~ git pull

~ git merge {branch}

~ git push

~ karo deploy -e production -r master

____________________________________
once deployed to production delete branches.

~ git branch -d {branch} (deletes the branch from local folder)

~ git push origin :{branch} (pushes nothing to github branch and therefor deletes it from github)
____________________________________

-e = environment
-r = branch
