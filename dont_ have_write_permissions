RUBY ERROR MESSAGE

this message occurs when trying to gem install bundler.

~ ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
  You don't have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0 directory.

Solution:
I installed ruby (rbenv) locally.

~ rbenv local 2.2.2

You can also install globally.

~ rbenv global 2.2.2
